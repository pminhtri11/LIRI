# LIRI

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

2. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests using the `axios` package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. The Node Packages for this Project are the following:

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

     * You'll use Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

3. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
